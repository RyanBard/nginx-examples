# Proxy Using Path Rewrites

A proxy example using url path rewrites.

To distinguish your services, you'll need to use the path on the request to route to the correct backend service.

Ex.

Caller's request would look like this:

```
GET /connector-service-1/abc
Host: your.domain.name
```

Backend service's request would look like this:
```
TODO
```
